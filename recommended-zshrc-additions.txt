# Recommended additions to .zshrc for robust PATH setup
# Add these lines to the beginning of your PATH configuration section

# ===== ROBUST PATH CONFIGURATION =====
# Ensure essential system paths are always available first
export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# Then add custom tools (existing configuration can stay after this)

# ===== EXISTING PATH ADDITIONS =====
# Your current PATH modifications would go here:
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH  # <- This line could be simplified since /usr/local/bin is now included above
# PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH"
# PATH="/Users/q247532/Library/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin:$PATH"
# ... etc

# ===== NVM CONFIGURATION IMPROVEMENT =====
# Load nvm and set a default version
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

# Set default node version (optional - consider removing hardcoded version)
# nvm use 18.0.0  # Consider using 'nvm alias default 18.0.0' instead

# ===== PATH VERIFICATION (Optional Debug) =====
# Uncomment the next line to see PATH when terminal starts (helpful for debugging)
# echo "PATH loaded: $PATH"

# ===== BACKUP SYSTEM =====
# Function to quickly fix PATH if it gets corrupted
fix_path() {
    export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
    source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    echo "✅ PATH restored"
}
